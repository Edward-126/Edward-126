# Hey, I'm Edward Hyde ðŸ‘‹ (A.K.A. Thilina Rathnayaka)

I'm a **web developer**, **UI/UX design enthusiast**, and your go-to **professional procrastinator** with a knack for turning ideas into interactive, engaging digital experiences. While I'm still an undergraduate, my best lessons often come from late-night YouTube marathons and deep dives into new tech.

## âœ¨ Fun Facts

- I'm obsessed with pixel-perfect designsâ€”call it perfectionism or just clean-freak vibes.
